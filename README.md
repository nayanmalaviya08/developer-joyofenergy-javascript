# Welcome to PowerDale

PowerDale is a small town with around 100 residents. Most houses have a smart meter installed that can save and send information about how much energy a house has used.

There are three major providers of energy in town that charge different amounts for the power they supply.

-   _Dr Evil's Dark Energy_
-   _The Green Eco_
-   _Power for Everyone_

# Introducing JOI Energy

JOI Energy is a new start-up in the energy industry. Rather than selling energy they want to differentiate themselves from the market by recording their customers' energy usage from their smart meters and recommending the best supplier to meet their needs.

You have been placed into their development team, whose current goal is to produce an API which their customers and smart meters will interact with.

Unfortunately, two members of the team are on annual leave, and another one has called in sick! You are left with another ThoughtWorker to progress with the current user stories on the story wall. This is your chance to make an impact on the business, improve the code base and deliver value.

## Story Wall

At JOI energy the development team use a story wall or Kanban board to keep track of features or "stories" as they are worked on.

The wall you will be working from today has 7 columns:

-   Backlog
-   Ready for Dev
-   In Dev
-   Ready for Testing
-   In Testing
-   Ready for sign off
-   Done

Examples can be found here [https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/kanban-board/](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/kanban-board/)

## Users

To trial the new JOI software 5 people from the JOI accounts team have agreed to test the service and share their energy data.

| User    | Smart Meter ID | Power Supplier        |
| ------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Sarah   | `smart-meter-0`      | Dr Evil's Dark Energy |
| Peter   | `smart-meter-1`      | The Green Eco         |
| Charlie | `smart-meter-2`      | Dr Evil's Dark Energy |
| Andrea  | `smart-meter-3`      | Power for Everyone    |
| Alex    | `smart-meter-4`      | The Green Eco         |

These values are used in the code and in the following examples too.
